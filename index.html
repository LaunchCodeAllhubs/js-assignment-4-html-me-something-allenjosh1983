               <h2>Chez Charlie</h2> 
               <p>"Chez Charlie" is one of the last places in "midtown" where you can still grab a cheap drink and meet some quality folks. 
                  From the Dj's to the bartenders, to the 20 something's toking on the back patio.
                  Chez Charlie is full to the brim with personality and mystery. Every dartboard, table, 
                  and barstool tells a story of nights past.
                  If you find yourself in midwtown, don't hesitate to pop in and contribute to the laughter and the legacy!   
               </p>
